### Question 3
What would you do to solve the following problem? Suppose a tub has an inflow of water of 10 $kg/hour$ and an outflow of water that increases with time by 2$t$ $kg/hour$, where $t$ is the time in hours. At the beginning (time = 0), the tub is empty. What is the mass $M$ of water in the tub after 2 hours? That is, what is $M$ after 2 hours if:

\( $\frac{dM}{dt} \) = 10 - 2t$

*For this, the question is "what would you do to solve this problem?"* 

* Integrate dM/dt from t=0 to t=2 hours 
* Evaluate dM/dt at t=2 hours 
* Set dM/dt=0 and solve for t
* Take the derivative of dM/dt and evaluate at t=2 hours
* Not use calculus and just reason out a solution

### Question 21
Imagine someone running on a hot day.  Their body temperature goes up and they start to sweat.  We could write that:

$\frac{d(sweat)}{d(temperature)}$

has a positive sign, because as body temperature increases, sweat also increases \frac{+}{+}=(+).  And, as body temperature decreases, sweat also decreases \frac{-}{-}=(+).  

When a person sweats, the sweat on their skin then evaporates and that evaporation changes their body temperature.  Thinking about the relationships between sweat, evaporation, and body temperature, what would be the sign of:

\( $\frac{d(sweat)}{d(temperature)} \) * \( \frac{d(evaporation)}{d(sweat)} \) * \( \frac{d(temperature)}{d(evaporation)}$? \)

* negative
* positive
* could be either negative or positive
* not enough information
* I do not know.
